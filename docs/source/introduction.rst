    ==============

PyDriosm is an open-source tool that provides an effortless way to download and access `OpenStreetMap <https://www.openstreetmap.org/>`_ (OSM) data in popular file formats, such as `shapefile <https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Shapefiles>`_ and `protobuf binary format <https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/PBF_Format>`_ (PBF), which are freely available from `Geofabrik <https://download.geofabrik.de/>`_ and `BBBike <https://download.bbbike.org/>`_.
